                <strong>Verge Ambassador Program</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The main goal of the Verge Ambassador Program is to educate and engage blockchain enthusiasts
                by providing them with the tools and community support they need to help Verge currency grow.
                Many (existing) community members may be willing to support Verge but are not sure where to
                start. Thatâ€™s where the ambassador program comes in, this group of individuals share a similar
                passion when it comes to expanding the Verge ecosystem, sharing knowledge and educating
                others in the field of blockchain technology, and in particular, Verge currency.
